If you include $x_1$ and $x_1^2$ in your model, it's still a linear model, since we can just write $x_2 = x_1^2$. The term <b>linear model</b> comes from the fact that we can always write this systematic component using vectors like $\\mathbf{x}^T\\beta$\n",

    "- In linear regression, the linear and link function predict the line of best fit. However, our observed values aren't always on the line; they're Normally distributed around the line.\n",
    "    * For ordinary least squares linear regression, we use the **normal distribution** for our random component.\n",
    "- In logistic regression, the linear and link function predict a probability for us. However, our observed values are 1s and 0s. By saying $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_i)$, we note that our $Y_i$ will be 1s and 0s that are drawn from a $\\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_i)$ distribution with some predicted value between 0 and 1.\n",
